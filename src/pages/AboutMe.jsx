      <p>
        My name is Nick Sokolowski and I'm a full stack developer from Wisconsin. I'm 35 years old and married. My interests include fitness, sports, and
        nerd culture such as gaming and anime. As a developer I'm hoping to work on an application in one of these spaces one day! Looking to settle into a career that is constantly evolving and I can master as I
        age!
