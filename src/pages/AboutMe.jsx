      <p>
      My name is Nick Sokolowski and I am a full stack developer living in Wisconsin.  As a developer, my ultimate goal is to work on applications in the nerd culture space, such as gaming or anime, or in fitness or sports.  I am looking forward to growing in a career that is constantly evolving, and that I can master with experience. I am loving life in my thirties, and enjoy spending time with my wife, family, and friends, as well as gaming, working out, and watching my favorite sports teams.
